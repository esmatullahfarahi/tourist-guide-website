            The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and democracy, gifted
            to the United States by France. Visitors can take a ferry to Liberty
            Island to get an up-close view of this iconic monument. You canâ€™t
            come to NYC without paying your respects to Lady Liberty. Given the
            crazy, high demand of this tourist attraction, you need to plan your
            visit in advance because tickets to the crown are limited and
            security queues are long. Your ticket to the Statue of Liberty can
            include only a visit to the base, i.e., Liberty Island. You can also
            visit Ellis Island to get your history fix on the millions of
            immigrants that arrived to NYC in the late 19th Century. If all you
            want is to see the Statue of Liberty from a distance, hop on the
            free (yes, free!) Staten Island Ferry to get a small tour of New
            York Harbor.

            Central Park is an oasis in the heart of Manhattan, offering a
            peaceful escape from the city's hustle and bustle. Visitors can
            enjoy scenic walking paths, picnics, boating, and various
            recreational activities. Think of Central Park as a neighborhood
            stretching from 59th St to 110th St. No matter the time of year,
            this nature haven has something to offer for everyone. Pick your
            favorite spot and have a picnic, enjoy a summer concert, take a
            guided walking tour, row on boats across the lake, go for a run next
            to real New Yorkers, ice-skate in winter, or just take a map and
            wander to find your favorite hidden spot. The Central Park
            Conservancy developed a free app (available on both IOS and Android)
            that will make exploring a piece of cake.
